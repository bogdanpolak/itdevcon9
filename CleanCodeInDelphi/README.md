# Clean Code in Delphi

**Summary**

> We all know that the quality of the code has a huge impact on the quality of the project. However, it is difficult to meet two programmers who write the code in a similar way. Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin) has an interesting approach to this topic and his books are widely recognized as the best guides in this area. During this session, Bogdan will show how to apply uncle Bob's principles in practice. Which ones suit the specificity of component and event based programming in Delphi. You will see mostly the same code.

### Motto

Clean code:
* is obvious for other programmers
* doesn't contain duplication
* is easier and cheaper to maintain

### Code Bed smells

* Dead code
* Speculative Generality - no need “what if?”
* Large classes
* God object
* Multiple languages in one file
* Framework core modifications
* Magic numbers - replace with const or var
* Long if conditions - replace with function
* Call super’s overwritten methods
* Circular dependency
* Circular references
* Sequential coupling
* Hard-coding
* Too much inheritance - composition is better than inheritance
